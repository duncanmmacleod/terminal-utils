Assorted terminal utilities to make my life a bit easier

# `/etc/`

The `/etc/` directory contains useful bash profile scripts, and other configuration setters, that can be used to simplify terminal life.

The `/etc/profile.sh` script can be sourced to activate _all_ of the configuration profiles in the `/etc/profile.d/` directory, e.g.

```bash
. /path/to/repo/etc/profile.sh
```
